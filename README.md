# Acetate

Acetate is a project under development. Started on April 26, 2021, this project was carried out as part of a personal work at the end of a web developer formation. Acetate aims to take stock of the activities available in Switzerland in the field of events (conferences, exhibitions, music, theater). The content of the site is made up of fake data. All pages and features are published for demonstration purposes. The source code of the project is free to access and fully available on github. Feel free to contact me for more information. Enjoy your visit.
